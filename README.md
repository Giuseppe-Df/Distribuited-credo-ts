Credo is a framework written in TypeScript for building **decentralized identity solutions** that aims to be compliant and **interoperable with identity standards across the world**. Credo is agnostic to any specific exchange protocol, credential format, signature suite or did method, but currently mainly focuses on alignment with [OpenID4VC](https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/), [DIDComm](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/) and [Hyperledger Aries](https://hyperledger.github.io/aries-rfcs/latest/).

## Quickstart

Documentation on how to get started with Credo can be found at https://credo.js.org/

## New Features in This Fork

This fork introduces a series of protocols enabling interaction between the Aries agent and a resource-constrained IoT device, specifically the ESP32. These protocols allow the ESP32 to integrate with other agents despite its limited computational and memory resources, ensuring seamless participation in agent-based communications.

The IoT device (ESP32) operates within a distributed system, offloading significant processing tasks to the main agent while managing its own connections and handling verifiable credentials. This distributed approach ensures the ESP32 can engage in agent operations without the need for extensive local data processing or storage.

For more details on the IoT device implementation, refer to the related repository [here](#https://github.com/Giuseppe-Df/IoTAgent). To run the agent, please follow the instructions found in the `/demo` repository. 

### Framework Evolution

The framework's evolution has resulted in the implementation of additional modules that should be integrated into the base agent, as demonstrated in `demo/src/BaseAliceAgent.ts`.

### Modified Files by Functionality

1. **Distributed Pack Protocol**  
   This protocol enables the distributed packaging process of messages, specifically required to sign the Content Encryption Key (CEK) with the sender's private key (ESP32).  
   - Files related to this change are located in:  
     `core/src/modules/distribuited-pack`

2. **Distributed Unpack Protocol**  
   This protocol facilitates the distributed unpackaging of messages, particularly necessary to decrypt the CEK with the recipient‚Äôs private key (ESP32).  
   - Files related to this change are located in:  
     `core/src/modules/distribuited-unpack`

3. **Public Key Exchange Protocol**  
   This protocol allows retrieval of the ESP32‚Äôs public key to be included in the DID Document (DIDDoc).  
   - Files related to this change are located in:  
     `core/src/modules/pubkey`

4. **Signature Exchange Protocol**  
   This protocol enables the retrieval of the signed version of the DID Document.  
   - Files related to this change are located in:  
     `core/src/modules/connections`

## Demo

To get to know the Credo issuance and verification flow, we built a demo to walk through it yourself together with agents Alice and Faber.

- OpenID4VC and SD-JWT VC demo in the [`/demo-openid`](/demo-openid) directory.
- DIDComm and AnonCreds demo in the [`/demo`](/demo) directory.
